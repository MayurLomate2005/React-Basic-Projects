   cd basic-react-project
Install dependencies:
npm install
Run the development server:
npm start
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000

🧠 How It Works
The App.js file acts as the main component.

Components can be added inside the components/ folder.

React renders the app into the root div in public/index.html.

📝 Customize
Add your own components inside /components.

Modify styles using your preferred CSS method.

Add routing using react-router-dom if needed.
